# Cemetary Nuker - Is it malware?
short answer, no. cemetary nuker isnt malware.

## if it isn't malware why does it get flagged?
because of Nuitka. nutika compiles py to exe and the way they use this is to protect the source code by using C# (i think?). you can also check here: [nuitka compiled exe in Windows is indentified as a virus/trojan #2701
](https://github.com/Nuitka/Nuitka/issues/2701)

## it gets flagged in virus total its got to be malware right?
virus total is complete shit. use [tria.ge](https://tria.ge/) instead. its more accurate and it uses a VM to give you everything that happens when u open the .exe

# [tria.ge](https://tria.ge) is the most reliable source.
